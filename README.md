TO DO:
Replace "Users" page with "Organization" page <-- I'm working on this one

Add extra modules to Dashboard
  -bar chart of tickets completed this week, by user
  
Add a "reports" page, that allows a manager/owner to view custom graphs

Possibly refactor search box and archive to be in separate places
Possibly add avatar photos
