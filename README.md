TO DO:
Replace "Users" page with "Organization" page <-- I'm working on this one

Finish "/new-ticket/:orgName"

Fix/finish issues with signup form
  -Allows password less than 8 characters
  -Auto log-in on successful creation
  -At some point we probably want to have email confirmation of any email addresses used

Add extra modules to Dashboard
  -bar chart of tickets completed this week, by user
  
Add a "reports" page, that allows a manager/owner to view custom graphs

Possibly refactor search box and archive to be in separate places
Possibly add avatar photos
